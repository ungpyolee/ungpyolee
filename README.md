## 🧠 How I Think

- UX problems should be solved **as close to the user as possible**
- Technology is a **tool for decision-making**, not a goal
- Read official docs, test assumptions, write down criteria
- Prefer **simple, explainable solutions** over clever ones

---

## ✍️ Writing & Learning

- Weekly UX case analysis
- Official documentation deep dives
- Decision criteria for:
  - SSR vs CSR
  - State placement
  - UI abstraction
  - Tech adoption

👉 I write to clarify my thinking, not just to record results.

## 🚀 Goals

- Become a **product-oriented frontend engineer**
- Grow toward **full-stack capability** with frontend focus
- Use AI as a **thinking & productivity tool**, not a shortcut
- Build services that I can explain clearly to both users and teammates
